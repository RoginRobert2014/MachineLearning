#Requirement Scope-

My intention of this proposal is to find whether a customer will file a claim on their travel so the
discounted premium can be offered to them if the chances are less likely to make a future claim. I
assume that I will be provided with the historical data of past policies, the insured, the purpose, and
destination of the travel and whether a claim was filed.

#Approach-
The above problem can be solved using different machine learning techniques.

For predicting the results, I would like to use regression techniques like
a) Linear Regression
b) Epsilon Support Vector Regression
c) Random Forest Regression
