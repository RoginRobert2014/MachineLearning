#Requirement Scope:-
My intention of this proposal is to find whether a customer will file a claim on their travel so the
discounted premium can be offered to them if the chances are less likely to make a future claim. I
assume that I will be provided with the historical data of past policies, the insured, the purpose, and
destination of the travel and whether a claim was filed.

#Approach: -
The above problem can be solved using different machine learning techniques.
I would like to propose predicting the customerâ€™s chances of filling a claim on their travel using the
classification approach provided the historical data.

The classification techniques which I would select as part of this approach might be as mentioned below
A) Decision Tree Classifier
B) Random Forests Classifier
C) SVM Classifier
